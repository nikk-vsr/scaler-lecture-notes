        "After analyzing the above bar plots we can conclude the following:\n",
        "1. Customers in cluster 1 on an average spend the most, they frequently visit the store and recency is the least that is re-orders these customers are our loyal customers and we should plan to award them.\n",
        "2. Customers in cluster 2 are spending less, their frequency of visit to the store is less but their re-order rate that is the recency is lower which means we'll have to figure out a way to make them more frequent customer ensuring they spend higher on an average\n",
        "3. Customers in cluster 0 spend less , their frequcy of visit is the lowest and their recency is the highest which means the reorder time period is too huge, we need to figure the reason for this and we can decide whether to drop these customers or not."
